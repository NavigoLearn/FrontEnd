The main path ( a chain of info nodes with main as their hierarchy ) is meant for general chapters and the secondary nodes for giving details on those chapters. The secondary nodes can have more secondary nodes, but this kind of nesting shouldn't go too far. \n"

adding a node adds another node with a connection to the current node \n
deleting a node will reroute all connections of its children nodes to the parent of the node \n
you can freely convert from between node types ( more on that later ) as long as it doesn't break the main node chain \n"
